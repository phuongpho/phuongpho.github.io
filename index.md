I'm Patrick (Phuong) Pho. I received my PhD in Big Data Analytics from [University of Central Florida (UCF)](https://sciences.ucf.edu/statistics/). Before that, I had my Master's degree in Statistical Computing from UCF.

Research interests: learning representation on graph structured data, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction. Recently, I'm exploring explainable AI and causal machine learning. 

During my study at UCF, I had plenty of opportunities to work on interesting data science projects. You can find the summarized results of my academic as well as personal works in [Projects](/Projects).
