## [Regularized Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) for improved interpretability of large datasets](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-020-00366-x)

Attributed graph is a powerful tool to model many complex systems in our world. It contains two valuable sources of information, i.e the node feautures and the network strucutre, which can be analyzed efficiently by graph neural networks (GNNs) to produce accurate inference for many downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, etc. The exponential growth of graph structured data drives the complexity of GNNs models causing concerns about processing time and interpretability of the results. This work extended a fast GNNs framework, namely the Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) by incorporating a flexible shrinkage to produce sparser fitted model highlighting key node features determining the class characteristics.
